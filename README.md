# numpy-array-filters

    I am a Linux user, but I believe all demos will work the same in a Windows computer. If there are any faults please let me know.
    This is a Jupyter Notebook demo showing how to create numpy image filters and save them as npy files. There is also a notebook showing how to use trackbars to experiment with different settings.
